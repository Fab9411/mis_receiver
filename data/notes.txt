How to include images:
- Put all the images in the images folder
- Name each screenshot of news you're using with their exact title reported in the news dataset
- Switch the images setting on in the setting.py file, by putting:
	images = True
- If you want to have both screenshots from websites and Facebook, put the screenshots in the proper folders, again using the exact title reported in the news dataset. Then, turn social = True in the settings.py

ATTENTION: If title contains some special symbol, you might need to delete it from both the file name and the title in the dataset
